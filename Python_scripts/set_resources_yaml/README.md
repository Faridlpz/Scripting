### Python Script Explanation:

#### Shebang Line:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```
This line specifies the interpreter to be used when executing a script.

### Imports

```imports
import yaml
import subprocess
```
Imports the necessary modules for the script. Yaml to import yaml configuration and subprocess to execute cmd commands.

```file
with open('deployments.yaml', 'r') as stream:
    deployments = yaml.safe_load(stream)
```
This part reads the YAML file named deployments.yaml and loads its contents into the deployments variable.

```Iterating Over Deployments
for deployment in deployments:
    deploymentName = deployment['deploymentName']
    limitsCPU = deployment['limitsCPU']
    requestsCPU = deployment['requestsCPU']
    limitsMemory = deployment['limitsMemory']
    requestsMemory = deployment['requestsMemory']

    print(f"Deployment: {deploymentName}")
    print(f"Limits CPU: {limitsCPU}")
    print(f"Requests CPU: {requestsCPU}")
    print(f"Limits Memory: {limitsMemory}")
    print(f"Requests Memory: {requestsMemory}")

    cmd = [
        "kubectl", "set", "resources", "deployment", deploymentName,
        "--limits=cpu=" + limitsCPU + ",memory=" + limitsMemory,
        "--requests=cpu=" + requestsCPU + ",memory=" + requestsMemory
    ]
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)



```
With the code provided we extract variuos parameters for each deployment and store them into variables. Therefore, to review the content we use print command to be sure that we extract the correct information. After we executed the command kubectl with the variables to update the configuration.

### YAML configuration
```
- deploymentName: insertValue
  limitsCPU: "680m"
  requestsCPU: "450m"
  limitsMemory: "1000Mi"
  requestsMemory: "1000Mi"
- deploymentName: insertValue
  limitsCPU: "960m"
  requestsCPU: "450m"
  limitsMemory: "1000Mi"
  requestsMemory: "1000Mi"
```
This YAML configuration defines two deployments. Each deployment has parameters such as deploymentName, limitsCPU, requestsCPU, limitsMemory, and requestsMemory, specifying resource limits and requests for CPU and memory.
This script essentially reads deployment information from a YAML file, executes kubectl commands to update resources for each deployment, and prints the status of each command execution.
